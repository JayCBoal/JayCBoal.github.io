"AutomationApp" or "AutoApp" is (or will be) a full-stack batch processing framework and development/tracking application.

Application will:
* Store job execution parameters in a separate database from the job scheduler to allow portability between scheduling products.
* Allow execution of most jobs via a single script.
* Standardize job logging, including writing structured data files listing details of operation(s) performed, to be loaded into application back-end.
* Provide a web-based user interface for searching, viewing, editing, and inserting data into back end.
* Allow non-technical users to request automation to streamline job development and deployment.

Ultimately the Web UI will be available on the public internet but itâ€™s still in development, and at any rate the Web UI is only one component of this framework and is not sufficient to illustrate it in its entirety.
